#  Vercel Configuration

Vercel handles client-side routing by using this config in vercel.json (already included if deployed correctly):

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
```
- This ensures routes like /auth or /dashboard donâ€™t give a 404 on refresh.

---
##  Authentication
- Login/signup system with JWT (stored in HttpOnly cookies)

- Protected routes handled on frontend and backend

##  License

- This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only.
