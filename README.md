## Getting Started (Local Setup)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- MongoDB (local or [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sohaibkundi2/url-shortener.git
cd url-shortener
```

### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will run on: `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
- #### Also change 
```
// in UrlForm.jsx

const BASE_URL = "api.shrtit.tech";
to 
const BASE_URL = http://localhost:3000

// And UserUrl.jsx

const BASE_URL = "https://shrtit.tech/";
to
const BASE_URL = "http://localhost:3000";
```

## Vercel Configuration

To enable client-side routing with React on Vercel, the following is included in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
```

This ensures routes like `/auth` or `/dashboard` do not return 404 on refresh.

---

## Authentication

- JWT-based authentication
- Tokens are stored in secure HttpOnly cookies
- Protected routes implemented on both frontend and backend
